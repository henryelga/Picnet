## About
Picnet is a social media platform that we developed as a way to challenge ourselves and expand our skills in server-side web development. We built Picnet from scratch using PHP, the Laravel framework, HTML, CSS and Javascript. Through the development of this project we had the opportunity to deeply refine our abilities in areas such as database management, API integration, user authentication, form validation, and front-end user experience design. We were able to demonstrate our knowledge of the Model-View-Controller architecture. It was a rewarding journey that allowed us to push the boundaries of our technical knowledge and problem-solving skills.

## Validation and Authorization
Picnet has strict validation requirements to ensure the safety and integrity of the platform:
- Passwords must be at least 8 characters long
- Passwords are encrypted
- Email and username must be unique
- Usernames are checked against a [Bad Words API](https://rapidapi.com/neutrinoapi/api/bad-word-filter/) to prevent the use of inappropriate content
  
Users must be authenticated to access the full range of features on Picnet. The platform uses a robust authorization system to ensure that only authorized users can perform actions such as creating, editing, and deleting their own content.
